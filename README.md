# Rest-Api-Builder
This application is the initial POC that I did for automating the REST API creation with zero deployment or code change. Once the API is registered, itâ€™s immediately available to use .This framework assumes that API should be READ in nature and your data has to be sourced from a single table or view. I have tested this framework for HANA, Snowflake and Oracle.
